# Web Crawler

As part of our research and development activities, the lab might launch a web crawler \(a bot\) to gather data on the web.

Our bot should have the following string in the User Agent description, where `x.x` is our internal bot ID.

> Joholabot/x.x \(+[https://docs.joholab.com/lab/v/en/about/web-crawler](https://docs.joholab.com/lab/v/en/about/web-crawler)\)

We write the program so that it does not cause an issue to your website. However, if you notice any issue, please contact us. We appreciate your understanding and help.
