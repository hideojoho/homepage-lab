Joho Lab is established in 2009 and since then we have been working on a range of topics in Human Information Interaction with a strong focus on Information Retrieval and Information Seeking Behaviour.

We are also an international lab and have had visiting scholars, exchange students, and international students from U.S., Ireland, Germany, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Iran, and China. We collaborate with the leading researchers all around the world.

We are always looking for students who are interested in the research on human information interaction and information retrieval. If you have a solid academic background in computer science or information science, and are interested in joining the lab, feel free to contact us.
